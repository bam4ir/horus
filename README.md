Horus gives your phone a full Alpine Linux ARM64 workspace and a proper
terminal to drive it, then puts the coding agents one tap away. Pick Claude
Code, Codex, OpenCode, or a plain zsh shell, point it at a project, and let it
work; sessions keep running with the screen off.

For the launch demo, Claude Code downloaded a film, installed ffmpeg, and cut
a trailer, while Codex trained a neural network from scratch to 97.97% on
MNIST. Both ran on a budget phone from 2021.

## 𓂻 Install

1. **Get the app** from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.scariflabs.horus/),
   or download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/scarif-labs/horus/releases/latest).
   Both are the same F-Droid-signed file, so you can switch between them and
   keep your data.
2. **Open Horus and set a password.** It downloads Alpine Linux (a few MB) and
   sets up the workspace.
3. **Tap an agent.** It installs on first open, and you sign in to your
   account inside the agent itself.

You need an ARM64 phone on Android 7.0 or newer. New to all this? The
[beginner's guide](https://scariflabs.com/horus/docs) starts from zero.

## 𓋹 What you get

<table>
<tr><td>

### 𓉐 A real Linux box
Alpine Linux in app storage, checked against a pinned SHA-256 before it's
unpacked. `git`, `curl`, `jq`, `rg`, `python3`, and Node arrive when you first
need them, and `apk add` gets you the rest.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

### 𓁟 Agents in one tap
Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode each install into their own home the first
time you open them, with the installer output right there in the terminal.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

### 𓏞 A terminal that behaves
Native PTY and renderer with resize, Ctrl‑C, and job control. The key bar
adds Esc, Tab, arrows, and sticky Ctrl/Alt for everything a phone keyboard
leaves out.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

### 𓊽 Sessions that outlive the app
Terminals run in a foreground service in their own process. Switch apps, lock
the phone, let Android kill the UI; the agent keeps going and notifies you
when it's waiting on you.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

### 𓊖 Projects and GitHub
Make a folder, clone any HTTPS or SSH URL, or pick from your GitHub repos
after a device login in the browser. Everything lives in `/workspace/projects`,
and a read-only file browser previews it and copies folders to Downloads.

</td></tr>
<tr><td>

### 𓂀 Private by default
No analytics, ads, crash reporting, or Google services. A password locks the
app after 15 minutes in the background, and Horus never touches your agent
credentials.

</td></tr>
</table>

## 𓊝 Use it from your computer (optional)

Horus works fully on the phone. If you also want to treat it like a small
cloud VM, plug it in over USB and use the [`horus` CLI](cli/README.md) for
SSH, file sync, port forwarding, and running one command on a whole drawer of
phones:

```sh
npm install -g horus-cli
horus pair
horus ssh
```

The SSH server listens on the phone's loopback only and reaches your computer
through `adb forward`, so nothing is exposed on Wi-Fi. Logins are key-only,
root is refused, and pairing needs your Horus password. **Settings → Remote
access** turns it off and lists paired computers you can revoke. The
[CLI guide](https://scariflabs.com/horus/docs/cli) covers setup from scratch.

## 𓇳 How it works

```
React Native UI (App.tsx, src/)
  │  TerminalRuntime TurboModule + TerminalCanvas / TerminalInput native views
  ▼
Kotlin native layer (android/app/src/main/java/com/scariflabs/horus/terminal)
  ├─ DistroStore*            rootfs download → verify → extract → promote
  ├─ ProotSessionLauncher    builds the PRoot command line and guest environment
  ├─ TerminalSessionService  foreground service in the :terminal process
  └─ NativeTerminalEngine / TerminalCanvasView  VT parsing and rendering
        │
        ▼
terminal_pty.c (JNI) ── PRoot (native/, built from source) ── Alpine rootfs
```

Each agent runs as its own guest user (UIDs 61001–61003) with a private home,
and they all share workspace GID 1000 so they can work on the same projects.

## 𓅃 Security notes

Android's app sandbox is the only real security boundary. PRoot emulates user
IDs but gives no kernel isolation between agent users, so don't run code you
don't trust.

Codex's own Linux sandbox doesn't work under PRoot, which is why the shell
wraps `codex` with `--sandbox danger-full-access`; Codex's approval prompts
still apply.

Remote access stays off until you pair a computer or turn it on. Any app on
the phone can reach loopback ports, so the paired key is what keeps others
out.

## 𓏛 For developers

<details>
<summary><b>Build from source</b></summary>

<br>

You need Node.js ≥ 22.11, JDK 17, and the Android SDK and NDK (the standard
[React Native environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)),
plus `make`, `bash`, and `git` for the native runtime.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/scarif-labs/horus.git
cd horus
npm ci
npm run build:android:debug      # or build:android:release
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Cloned without `--recurse-submodules`? Run `git submodule update --init` to
fetch the PRoot and libandroid-shmem sources.

Debug builds embed the JavaScript bundle, so they start without Metro. They
also skip the password screens and open straight into a development terminal;
release builds have the full onboarding and lock flow.

Release builds stay unsigned unless you pass a keystore through Gradle
properties, for example in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

```properties
horus.releaseStoreFile=/path/to/release.keystore
horus.releaseStorePassword=...
horus.releaseKeyAlias=...
horus.releaseKeyPassword=...
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Tests</b></summary>

<br>

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:unit                # Jest (TypeScript / React Native)
npm run test:kotlin              # JVM unit tests for the native layer
npm run test:android:connected   # instrumented tests on a connected device
```

PRs and pushes to `main` run Node checks, host native regressions, Android JVM
tests, and unsigned release APK validation. See the
[CI and release maintainer guide](docs/maintainers/ci-and-releases.md) for the
pinned toolchain, local commands, required checks, and release acceptance.

<details>
<summary><b>Permissions</b></summary>

<br>

| Permission | Why |
| :-- | :-- |
| `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Download Alpine, packages, and agents; show network state on the home screen |
| `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE` | Keep terminal sessions running in a separate `:terminal` process while the UI is closed |
| `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | One notification per running session, and "waiting for you" when an agent finishes a turn |
| `WAKE_LOCK` | Keep the CPU awake while a session is running |
| `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` | Asked for during setup so Android doesn't pause long agent runs |
| `VIBRATE` | Short haptic feedback on button taps |
| `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (API ≤ 28 only) | Copy a folder to `Download/Horus` on old Android versions |

The diagnostic log stays on the device and records lifecycle metadata only,
never terminal input or output.

**Anti-features**

- **NonFreeNet.** Horus downloads Alpine Linux, its packages, and the coding
  agents from their upstream servers. Claude Code and Codex need accounts with
  their providers.
- **NonFreeAdd.** Horus offers to install Claude Code, which is proprietary.
  Codex (Apache-2.0), OpenCode, and the plain shell are free software. Horus
  never handles provider credentials; sign-in happens inside each CLI.

**Built from source**

- **PRoot, talloc, and libandroid-shmem** are compiled during the Gradle build
  by [`scripts/native/build-proot-runtime.sh`](scripts/native/build-proot-runtime.sh):
  - `native/proot`: submodule, [termux/proot](https://github.com/termux/proot) v5.1.107.92, GPL-2.0-or-later;
  - `native/libandroid-shmem`: submodule, [termux/libandroid-shmem](https://github.com/termux/libandroid-shmem) v0.7, BSD-3-Clause;
  - `native/talloc`: talloc 2.4.3 core sources, vendored, LGPL-3.0-or-later.

  Horus's own changes are in [`native/patches/`](native/patches/). The build
  writes a runtime manifest with each binary's SHA-256, and the app refuses to
  start PRoot if the installed binaries don't match it.
- **The PTY** is [`android/app/src/main/cpp/terminal_pty.c`](android/app/src/main/cpp/terminal_pty.c)
  (JNI).
- **Hermes bytecode compiler.** Gradle uses `node_modules/hermes-compiler`'s
  bundled `hermesc` by default. Set `horus.hermesCommand` (see
  [`android/app/build.gradle`](android/app/build.gradle)) to use one built from
  source instead. The F-Droid recipe builds `hermesc` from the Hermes srclib
  and deletes the prebuilt one.

No binaries are committed except `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`.

**Runtime downloads:** a pinned Alpine minirootfs from
`dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org`, checked against a SHA-256 in
[`AlpineRootfsCatalog.kt`](android/app/src/main/java/com/scariflabs/horus/terminal/AlpineRootfsCatalog.kt),
then Alpine packages, then each agent from its publisher the first time it is
opened.
